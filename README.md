# kicad_releaser

To use:
Copy the `github` folder into your Kicad repo as `.github`. e.g. the `main.yml` should end up in `<top level git repo>/.github/workflows/main.yml`. Deliberately not done here as that'll cause the Github runner to run on this repo!

Don't worry about the rest of the source code, it'll be cloned automatically through the Github runner.
